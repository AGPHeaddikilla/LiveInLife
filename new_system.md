##TODO for a new system:

The packages should have a more precise name. Means that for example the current package `lilc_shops` should be renamed to their specific shop type: `lilc_shops_clothing`, `lilc_shops_items`, `lilc_shops_vehicles`.
This way the packages can be configured more easily and its more organized.

The general thoughts of LiveInLife are the following:
* provide easy customization
* provide a big reportoire of functions and "modules"
* not predefine any mission compositions
