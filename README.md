LiveInLife is an adjustable framework for your ArmA 3 roleplay ideas.

## What is LiveInLife
**LiveInLife** is a small idea of creating an free-to-use "library" (it isn't really is a library...) for ArmA 3 RPG-Server's. **LiveInLife** was created to support developers of RPG-Server's who want to create "their own" RPG-Modification or so-called mission.
There are currently just a few packages available.

Because **LiveInLife** is in development status - problems and other issues are common in this state.

**LiveInLife** does not pretend anything in your mission - it's up to you choose between possibilities!

## Installation

## Future of the LiveInLife backend
In the future, **LiveInLife** will use an API server to handle any database or ArmA-3-Server-To-Database connections.
Thus, knowledge about API-server-concepts is required such as hosting this kind of server(s).
